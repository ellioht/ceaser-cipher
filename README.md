# This is my Rolling Caeser Cipher project
You can enter a message and toggle between encoding or decoding the message.
- Key 1 will shift the characters of the message by the amount you give it.
- Key 2 will shift each following character by the amount. (so with a value of 1 it will keep adding one every following character)
